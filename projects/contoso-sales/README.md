**📌 Executive Summary**  
Overall revenue decline hits most markets and channels. Strong growth in small categories hasn't offset revenue lost from large categories shrinking, resulting in an overall global revenue drop of **`-9.05%`**.

**Macro Regions**  
 **Asia** is the only region showing growth (`+8.81%`), heavily driven by **China** (the second-largest market, up `+6%`) and **Japan** (`+16.77%`), with explosive spikes in Thailand (`+64%`), South Korea (`+61%`), and Bhutan (`+55%`). **United States**, the primary and largest market, crashed by `-15.85%`, suffering a significant loss in global revenue share, which dropped from **56.7% down to 52.5%** in 2025. All markets across **Europe** continue to experience stagnation, resulting in an overall decline of `-9.22%`.

**Distribution Channels**  
**Online** is the only growing channel globally (`+1.46%`), primarily because it serves as the main distribution channel in China and maintained stable growth over the 2024–2025 period. **Store** revenue fell the sharpest (`-13.35%`), which was directly caused by the overall sales decline in the US market, where brick-and-mortar stores typically generate **58%** of total revenue.

**Product Categories**  
 **Home Appliances**, **Computers**, and **Cameras & Camcorders** (core drivers)form the financial backbone of the business, accounting for **75.7%** of total global revenue.
 Critically, two of these core backbone categories (**Home Appliances** and **Cameras & Camcorders**) became the top losers in 2025, with both shrinking by approximately `-22%`. Strong growing categories like **Games & Toys** (`+56.54%`) and **Audio** (`+30.69%`) (growth outliers) showed strong momentum but contribute barely **\$0.1bn** combined. This minor volume was completely insufficient to offset the heavy losses from the shrinking core segments, so overall revenue is still down 9.05%

### 2. Regional Trends Page

The **Regional Trends** page is built to provide regional managers and stakeholders with deep visibility into geographical performance. It effectively answers the following critical business questions:

*   **Which markets are driving the company's global revenue, and which are shrinking?**
*   **What is the exact financial impact in revenue and profit across different countries?**
*   **How does seasonal sales performance vary across major continents and countries throughout the year?**
*   **What are the operational footprints within specific countries?**
*   **How do these regional trends shift when filtering by specific years or distribution channels?**

### 3. Products. What Sells
This page provides a comprehensive analysis of product performance, sales distribution, and profitability. It is designed to help product managers, inventory planners, and executives identify where to invest or divest cash (BCG framework) and how to optimize cash flow and warehouse stock (ABC-XYZ matrix). It achieves this by highlighting top-revenue product segments, evaluating growth trajectories, assessing demand predictability, and analyzing the overall product mix.

**📌 Global BCG Matrix Insights & Recommendations**

**Stars (Business Drivers)**
* **Key Subcategory:**  Laptops are single-handedly keeping the company afloat during this market downturn.
* **Strategic Recommendation: Protect and Maximize**  
  Ensure flawless supply chain continuity, secure adequate inventory levels, and prioritize cash allocation for this segment. Shift any underutilized marketing budgets from stagnant categories directly into Laptops to sustain growth.

**Cash Cows (Protective Assets in Decline)**
* **Key Subcategories:** **Camcorders** (`-35.70%`),**Projectors & Screens** (`-14.83%`), **Home Theater Systems** (`-15.50%`),**Washers & Dryers** (`-54.21%`),**Digital SLR Cameras** (`-15.86%`)
* **Strategic Recommendation: Harvest and Optimize**  
  Implement strict inventory controls and reduce safety stocks for rapidly declining segments (like washers and video cameras) to prevent cash from being frozen in slow-moving warehouse stock.

**Question Marks (Future Growth Pockets)**
* **Key Subcategories:**  **Cell Phones Accessories** (`+153.87%`),**Download Games** (`+120.82%`),**Cameras & Camcorders Accessories** (`+105.30%`),**Fans** (`+65.56%`),**Computers Accessories** (`+35.23%`), **Televisions** (`+20.44%`),**Monitors** (`+11.29%`).
  These categories are successfully capturing current consumer trends. Mobile and PC accessories are expanding rapidly, but because they currently account for a very low share of sales (**under 2%**), they do not yet impact the total bottom line.
* **Strategic Recommendation: Selective Scaling via Cross-Selling**  
  Focus heavily on high-margin co-products like **Cell Phones Accessories** and **Computers Accessories** to expand their market share.

**Dogs (Inventory Ballast)**
* **Key Subcategories:**  
  * **Desktops** (`-46.60%`),   **Water Heaters** (`-33.80%`),  **Movie DVDs** (`-29.79%`), **Air Conditioners** (`-21.17%`), **Lamps** (`-18.34%`).
  * These products provide neither growth nor volume, actively burning working capital and occupying valuable warehouse space. Stationary Desktops are completely losing the battle to mobile laptops, and Movie DVDs represent an obsolete market.
* **Strategic Recommendation: Aggressive Rationalization / Divestment**  
  **Completely discontinue Movie DVDs.** Execute aggressive promotional clearances or flash sales for **Desktops** and **Water Heaters** to quickly liquidate remaining stock and free up warehouse capacity.

### 4. Scenario Analysis Page
The Scenario Analysis is a financial simulation model to evaluate KPIs for the following business goal: increase of global market share via implementation of a new discount policy.  

**Data Methodology Note**:
*Because this portfolio project utilizes a synthetic dataset, it lacks the behavioral patterns and granular transaction history required to statistically calculate a true price elasticity coefficient (the exact relationship between discount depth and demand growth). Consequently, the dashboard is designed as a deterministic simulation tool. It allows stakeholders to manually input their own strategic assumptions or market expectations regarding demand elasticity to instantly visualize the potential financial outcomes.*

**📌Scenario Evaluation: impact analysis of 4% Discount and 9% Demand Growth Assumptions**

The core insight reveals that implementing **a new discount policy resulting in a 4% discount depth** (increased from the baseline of 1.68%), which is projected to expand sales volume and **increase demand by 9%** (stakeholders' assumption), will result in a net profit increase only if the company successfully keeps cost-push inflation or **supplier price growth under 2-2.5%**.

As shown in the simulated scenario, allowing cost inflation to escalate to 3.00% triggers a 12.27% jump in COGS (+$196M), completely outpacing the 5.08% expansion in Net Revenue (+$188M) and **resulting in a 0.40% drop in Gross Profit**.
